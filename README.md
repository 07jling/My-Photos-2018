# My-Photos-2018
1990 to now, I start to do a lot photography for most of Chinese events in Auckland. Over many hundreds images I supplied to the Chinese medias and communities are free of charge. I also did signs and design works for lots of communities charity organizations for over 20 years, without charge, or minimum cost of materials.
